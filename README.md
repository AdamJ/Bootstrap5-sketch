# Bootstrap5-sketch
A Sketch library of Bootstrap 5 components and examples. Not official and not guaranteed to match 100%.

## About this library

### Intended purpose
The intended purpose of this library is to provide a starting point for designing with the Bootstrap front-end toolkit.

### Customizations
The majority of the components are based as close to the Bootstrap 5 version as possible. I have made custom components and layouts based on my needs that you may or may not wish to use. Any custom components do not have corresponding code available for use.

### Why?
I created this because I needed a Sketch library for creating Bootstrap 5 based sites. I figured why not create a Sketch library for others to use as well.
